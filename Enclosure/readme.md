# Enclosure

All 3D printed files were created with the free open-source CAD software Blender - download here:

## Faceplates
The enclosure is designed to use a Hammond 1590BB Aluminum enclosure, with a 3D-printed faceplate. Two faceplate designs are provided in the faceplates folder.

## Knobs
The project uses standard 7.3mm knurled potentiometers, and a series of 3D-printed knob designs are available:
1. `_knurledKnobInsert_7.3mm` is a file of a standard knurled potentiometer shaft, and can be used to create your own knob design
2. `knurledKnobDome_20mm-Dome` is a large knurled dome knob
3. `knurledKnobFlatWide_18mm-Circle.stl` and `knurledKnobFlatWide_20mm-Main_body` were created to make it easy to turn a knob with one finger. These designs are full-height and meant to work with standard enclosure.
	* `knurledKnobFlatWide_20mm_pointer-Pointer` is a small shape inset into the top of the above knobs to use as a pointer
4. `knurledKnobFlatWide_20mmTop_rounded-Circle` and `knurledKnobFlatWide_20mmTop-pointA-Circle_001` are half-height knobs, intended to be used with recessed potentiometers. 
	* `knurledKnobFlatWide_20mmTop-pointB-Circle_001` is a pointer for these knobs.
	
## USB-C port
This is a cap meant to be used to cover the hole drilled for the PCB's USB-C jack. It is oversized to allow a cable to pass the the cap.
